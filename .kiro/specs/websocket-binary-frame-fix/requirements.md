# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ESP32S3CAM device successfully connects to WiFi via QR code scanning and establishes a WebSocket connection to stream video frames to the CameraApp server. The ESP32 monitor shows successful frame transmission, but the frontend web interface fails to display the video feed. The issue lies in the frontend's inability to properly handle binary WebSocket frames containing JPEG image data sent from the ESP32S3CAM device.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the camera dashboard, I want to see live video feeds from my ESP32S3CAM devices, so that I can monitor the camera streams in real-time through the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ESP32S3CAM sends binary WebSocket frames containing JPEG data THEN the frontend SHALL properly decode and display the frames as images
2. WHEN binary frame data is received via Socket.IO THEN the frontend SHALL convert the data to the correct format for image display
3. WHEN a camera is streaming THEN the video element SHALL update continuously with new frames
4. WHEN frame data is processed THEN memory SHALL be properly managed to prevent leaks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the camera system, I want proper error handling and logging for binary frame processing, so that I can identify and resolve streaming issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN binary frame processing fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN frame data is malformed THEN the frontend SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN WebSocket connection issues occur THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed to the user
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN frame processing statistics SHALL be logged

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with multiple cameras, I want all camera feeds to display simultaneously without performance degradation, so that I can monitor multiple locations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple cameras are streaming THEN each camera feed SHALL display independently
2. WHEN processing multiple binary streams THEN the frontend SHALL maintain acceptable performance
3. WHEN one camera stream fails THEN other camera streams SHALL continue to function normally
4. WHEN camera status changes THEN the UI SHALL reflect the current streaming state accurately
